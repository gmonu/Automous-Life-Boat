          An autonomous vehicle (AV) is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating
          without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle
          at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. An autonomous
          vehicle can go anywhere a traditional vehicle goes and do everything that an experienced
          human driver does
